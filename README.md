# Video Library Sample Project

This is a sample project to test web development skills.

The project core is built using the static site generator [Harp.js](https://harpjs.com/). For this specific app, we use EJS for templating and SCSS for styles. To help speed up our styling we use [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) and [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) from [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/).

## Installation

To get started, fork this repo and clone the repository.

Make sure we have Node and npm installed, and then we're ready to install Harp!

```
npm i -g harp
```

Once Harp is installed `cd` into the project directory and run:

```
harp server
```

Now you can visit the site at [http://localhost:8000]! :tada:
